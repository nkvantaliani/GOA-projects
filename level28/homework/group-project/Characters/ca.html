        <p class="pos_cen" style="border: 1px solid #090336;" >Captain America is a superhero created by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby who appears in American<br> comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in Captain America Comics<br> #1, published on December 20, 1940, by Timely Comics, a corporate predecessor to Marvel. Captain<br> America's civilian identity is Steve Rogers, a frail man enhanced to the peak of human physical<br> perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining the United States Army to aid<br> the country's efforts in World War II. Equipped with an American flagâ€“inspired costume and a virtually<br> indestructible shield, Captain America and his sidekick Bucky Barnes clashed frequently with the<br> villainous Red Skull and other members of the Axis powers. In the final days of the war, an accident<br> left Captain America frozen in a state of suspended animation until he was revived in modern times.<br> He resumes his exploits as a costumed hero and becomes leader of the superhero team the Avengers,<br> but frequently struggles as a "man out of time" to adjust to the new era</p>
