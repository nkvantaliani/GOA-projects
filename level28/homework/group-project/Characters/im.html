    <p class="pos_cen" style="border: 1px solid #8a0303;" >Iron Man is the superhero persona of Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark, a businessman<br> and engineer who runs the weapons manufacturing company Stark Industries. When<br> Stark was captured in a war zone and sustained a severe heart wound, he built his Iron<br> Man armor and escaped his captors. Iron Man's suits of armor grant him superhuman strength,<br> flight, energy projection, and other abilities. The character was created in response to the Vietnam<br> War as Lee's attempt to create a likeable pro-war character. Since his creation, Iron Man has been<br> used to explore political themes, with early Iron Man stories being set in the Cold War. The character's<br> role as a weapons manufacturer proved controversial, and Marvel moved away from geopolitics by the<br> 1970s. Instead, the stories began exploring themes such as civil unrest, technological advancement,<br> corporate espionage, alcoholism, and governmental authority.</p>
